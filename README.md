# My Virtual Library (work in progress)
My Virtual Library application is my final project for Udacity's Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree Program to demonstrate core Android Development skills.

## Getting started

## Built With

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects. 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local database storage.
